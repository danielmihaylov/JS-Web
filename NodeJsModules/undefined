        <h3>Title  Jerry Smith</h3>
        <p> Jerry Smith is the husband of Beth Smith, and the father to Summer Smith and a deceased Morty, although he currently acts as the father, and son-in-law, of the Morty Smith and Rick Sanchez from Dimension C-137, respectively. He shares the same history as his C-137 counterpart until the Cronenberg disaster, where it was averted in his dimension.

Jerry always tries to think of the best interest of the family, but his attempt to be the patriarch of the family can often be misguided by his self-centered nature. This causes him a great deal of conflict with Rick, as his father-in-law clearly has no respect for him whatsoever.
